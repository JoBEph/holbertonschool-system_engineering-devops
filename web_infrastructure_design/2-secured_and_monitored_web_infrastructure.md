![Exercice 2](Diagram/Exercice%202.png)
**User Request**: A user accesses the internet and sends a request to reach a web application.

**DNS Resolution**: The domain is translated into an IP address via the DNS system.

**Load Balancers (HAProxy)**: The request passes through two load balancers, which distribute traffic to prevent overload and improve availability.

**Firewall and SSL Encryption**: Firewalls filter traffic and SSL encryption secures communication between the user and the servers.

**Web Servers (Nginx)**: The request reaches Nginx web servers, which handle static and dynamic content.

**Application Servers**: The request is processed by the application, executing necessary operations.

**Databases (MySQL)**: If data is needed, the request is sent to a MySQL database, protected by a firewall and secured with SSL.

**Response to the User**: The processed data is sent back to the user through the same optimized and secure system.
