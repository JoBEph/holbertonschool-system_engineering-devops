  **User Request**: The process begins when a user sends a request to access a website (`www.foobar.com`).

 **DNS Resolution**: The request goes through the Domain Name System (DNS) to find the correct IP address of the server hosting the website.

 **Firewall Protection**: The request passes through firewalls that filter out malicious traffic and ensure security.

 **Load Balancing**: The request is distributed across multiple servers using **Anycast load balancers** to optimize performance and prevent overload.

 **SSL Encryption**: Data is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure a secure communication between the user and the web server.

 **Web Servers (Nginx)**: The request reaches Nginx servers, which handle traffic and direct it to the appropriate application server.

 **Application Processing**: The request is processed by application servers, where the website’s logic and functionalities are executed.

 **Database Access**: If required, the application server retrieves or stores data in MySQL databases.

 **Response to User**: The processed data is sent back to the user through the same secured and optimized network.
